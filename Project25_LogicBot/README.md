# Project 25: Sentinel-Bot (Logic-Based Chatbot)

## Overview
A Python-based conversational agent that utilizes keyword tokenization and intent mapping to interact with users. Unlike basic conditional bots, this version evaluates user input contextually to provide the most relevant response.

## Technical Features
- **Tokenization Engine:** Breaks user strings into searchable tokens for multi-word analysis.
- **Intent Mapping:** Uses a weighted dictionary system to categorize user queries.
- **Simulated Latency:** Implements the `time` module to provide a more human-like interaction flow.

## Execution
1. Run: `python chatbot.py`
2. Interact with the bot using natural language regarding IT, Church, or Laptops.
