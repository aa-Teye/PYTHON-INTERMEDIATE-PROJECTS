30 Intermediate Python Projects: A 3-Year Journey
Welcome to my collection of intermediate Python projects. This repository represents my transition from foundational coding to building functional, real-world tools and automated systems.

🚀 The Journey
Over the last three years, I have moved from writing simple "Hello World" scripts to developing software that handles data analytics, security, and system automation. These 30 projects are a "push" to refine my skills in:

Automation & Scripting (OS modules, file handling)

Data Science & Analytics (CSV processing, web scraping)

Cybersecurity (Encryption and secure vaulting)

System Monitoring (Network and status checkers)
