### 📄 Project 08: NetAnalyzer Statistics Engine

## 📖 Overview

**NetAnalyzer** is the data processing component of the Network Monitoring Suite. It takes raw connectivity logs generated by [Project 07](https://github.com/aa-Teye/PYTHON-INTERMEDIATE-PROJECTS) and transforms them into actionable performance insights using the **Pandas** library.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python 3.13
* **Library:** `pandas` (Data Analysis)
* **Data Format:** CSV (Input/Output)

## 🚀 Team Lead Workflow (Branching Practice)

To simulate the environment for the **Church Website Team**, this project was developed using:

1. **Feature Branching**: Work isolated in `feature/netanalyzer-logic`.
2. **Atomic Commits**: Small, descriptive save points.
3. **Pull Requests**: Code review before merging into `main`.

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

1. **Sync the repository**:
```powershell
git checkout feature/netanalyzer-logic
git pull origin main --rebase

```


2. **Install dependencies**:
```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt

```


3. **Run the Analysis**:
```powershell
python analyzer.py

```



## 📊 Expected Output

The script generates a `performance_summary.csv` containing:

* **Average Latency**: Mean response time per site.
* **Uptime Extremes**: Minimum and Maximum recorded speeds.
* **Site Comparison**: Performance delta between Google, GitHub, and local servers.
